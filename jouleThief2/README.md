# How to Run the Joule Thief Project 2
## NOTE: These instructions assume you know how to compile cpp file using the format: "g++ <file.cpp> -o run; run" <br/>

1. Run the "writer.cpp" program to generate a "jouleFile.txt" text file for the "driver.cpp" program to use. The text file will be in the correct format needed to run the "driver.cpp" program.<br/>
    a. When running the "writer.cpp" program, you will be asked to enter the number of items to pick from and the max weight capacity for the knapsack. Enter positive integers for these values, otherwise you will be continually asked for the input.
1. Run the "driver.cpp" program to observe the greedy algorithm output for the 0-1 Knapsack problem.<br/>
    a. Note that the "driver.cpp" includes "dynamic.h" and this file needs to be in reach of the "driver.cpp" program for it to run.<br/>
    b. In addition, the file generated by the "writer.cpp" program produces the file needed to run the "driver.cpp". Should the "writer.cpp" file have not been run first, or there not be a "jouleFile.txt" within reach of the "driver.cpp" program, so this program will not run.
1. To view the sample runs for 10 and 20, view textfiles "knapsack10.txt" and "knapsack20.txt" respectively.
